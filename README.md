*Welcome to my professional profile built with:*

 1. ## Next.js

 

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

>## Getting Started

>First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

>Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

>You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

>[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

>The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

>This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

>## Learn More

>To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

>- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

>You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

>## Deploy on Vercel

>The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
