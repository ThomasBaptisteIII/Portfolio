              Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Thomas Baptiste, and I am a
              young developer with a passion for technology and a drive to
              become a full-stack developer. I will graduate in May and am
              excited to take the next step in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation
              in computer science, web development, and programming languages
              like Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I have also completed various
              projects, individually and as part of a team, which have given me
              practical experience in developing web applications and mobile
              apps.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As a full-stack developer, I aim to utilize my skills to create
              innovative and user-friendly web applications that solve
              real-world problems. I believe in a user-centered approach to
              development, where the end-user is always at the forefront of the
              design process. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for
              creating clean, efficient code, I am confident in delivering
              high-quality products.{" "}

              about the opportunities and look forward to connecting with you
              soon!
